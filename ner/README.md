# Overview

The goal of this analysis was for me to gain beginner experience with natural language processing libraries such as spaCy, using pretrained models to extract meaningful information from natural text.

This specific analysis uses the spaCy pretrained `en_core_web_lg` named entity recognition (NER) model to extract information from a 180,000 word document, Dune by Frank Herbert.

My ultimate goal was to discover how the author intended the reader to view the organization known as the Bene Gesserit, to see if their intended portrayal changes throughout the series (sentiment analysis). However, I have not quite been able to get to the point of performing a sentiment analysis yet.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This analysis was done primarily using R and Python. The spacy NLP library was used for NER, and tidyverse was used for further wrangling.

# Future Work

- Do an analysis of the most important relationships in Dune (i.e. which two characters are most frequently mentioned in the same sentence/paragraph/chapter)
- Sentiment analysis of the Bene Gesserit
