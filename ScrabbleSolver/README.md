# Overview

My main goal with this project was to improve my ability to program with complex data structures, use datasets in C#, and find efficient algorithms for completing tasks. Also I wanted to cheat in Scrabble.

The purpose of this software is to be a dynamic "answer key" to help anyone playing a game of scrabble, banangrams, or any other word-based board game that deals with anagrams.

# Development Environment

This program was developed using the LINQ library in C#, http requests, and VSCode.

The program was built exclusively in C#.

# Useful Websites

- [Scrabble Dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeisler/scrabble/master/db/dictionary.csv) (Careful, it's very large)
- [More on power sets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/power-set/)

# Future Work

- This program would greatly benefit from a GUI.
- Need to debug the handling of board requisites larger than 2 spaces apart.
- Make it so users can put multiple board requisites to intersect more than 2 words.
